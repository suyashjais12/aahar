					We see places lit up, with glee and we know, it's the time
					around Dusshera, Durga Puja and Navratre!" Just, when whole
					of the country indulged itself into the festivities in the
					year 2017, Desire Foundation, had different plans. After
					great efforts, tireless hours of planning and blood-sweat
					hard work, we came up with this great idea, helping the kids
					celebrate this occasion with equal happiness! On the 30th of
					September and 1st of October, Desire Foundation had
					organized a two-day Food Donation drive by the name "Ahaar"
					for the blind and homeless children across Mumbai and
					Durgapur. Aahar in Mumbai, was in association with BOX8,
					which sponsored freshly cooked, warm meal boxes, and we
					volunteered its distribution amongst the deserving. This was
					successfully completed, feeding 250 children in Mumbai and
					Navi Mumbai. We have always lived by the motto, that basic
					rights, like food, water and education should be accessible
					by all. And during the biggest festive season in India, they
					didn't back off from their responsibilities, but tried and
					successfully ensured a proper meal for the underprivileged
					kids of Mumbai. After being fed with good, warm meal, the
					shine in the eyes of those kids were greater than the
					greatest treasure. Nobody can, and should be left to enjoy
					with an empty stomach. We are a group of very close knit,
					and passionate youngsters who realise our responsibility
					towards the society and move forward with an initiative to
					change and revolutionize the society, are ready to take up
					more such challenges.

										It was our desire to do something not
										done before. It was our desire to help
										few underprivileged and see them smile.
										As days passed, more friends joined us
										and the joy of on-boarding big names
										like Box8 can't be explained in words.
										They sponsored the food packets for all
										the orphans we planned to feed. To our
										surprise big publicity groups joined
										hands to promote our event in big
										banners across Mumbai. It was magical.
										On one hand, we could see the kids eat a
										good meal and on the other our name was
										displayed in the heart of the commercial
										capital of India. I will cherish these
										moments throughout my life.

										When the innocent kids in this beautiful
										world are neglected, when they are
										forced to the shadows because they are
										not a part of the conventional society,
										then organisations like Desire
										Foundation & Andal Pariwar stand by
										them. They are brought back to the
										light, so that they can spend a healthy
										and normal life just like everyone else.
										Andal Pariwar has changed the lives of
										25 kids belonging to the underprivileged
										background by including them in the
										conventional society with providing
										food, health, education and
										entertainment. The key ingredient for
										making a person honest and righteous is
										education. Desire Foundation has helped
										in this educational aspect along with
										the other daily needs of the kids. When
										all around people were immersed in the
										festivities of Durga puja during the
										year 2017, Desire Foundation in
										collaboration with Andal Pariwar,
										arranged a sumptuous Aahar(meal) for the
										kids. On this day the kids were taken to
										a temple. They played and laughed
										against the serene backdrop of the
										sanctuary and we prepared a meal for
										them. Our goal was to see the smile on
										their innocent faces. Their happiness
										knew no bounds. We hope that these kids
										have a happy and peaceful future. They
										evolve as humans in the true sense of
										the term. We wish them all the best.
